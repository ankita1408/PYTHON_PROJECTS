## [1. Exploratory Data Analysis on World Population Trends](https://github.com/ankita1408/PYTHON_PROJECTS/tree/master/EDA%20IN%20PANDAS)

### Overview
This project involved analyzing a population dataset spanning from 1970 to 2022, segmented by countries and continents. The goal was to explore and validate trends in world population, with a focus on key patterns across different continents.

### Steps Taken:
- **Data Validation & Exploration**: 
  - Used `.info()`, `.describe()`, and `.nunique()` to assess the dataset's structure and completeness.
- **Data Cleaning**:
  - Handled missing values using `isnull()` to clean the data.
- **Continent-Wise Aggregation**:
  - Calculated average population growth trends from 1970 to 2022 to reveal significant patterns.
- **Visualization**:
  - Generated correlation heatmaps to explore relationships between numeric variables.
  - Created interactive visualizations using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**, including boxplots, heatmaps, and trendline charts.
- **Key Insights**:
  - Identified the top 10 countries by population in 2022.
  - Highlighted world population percentages by continent and significant trends in global population growth.

## 2. [Customer Call List Data Cleaning](https://github.com/ankita1408/PYTHON_PROJECTS/tree/master/DATA%20CLEANING%20IN%20PANDAS)

### Overview
In this project, the goal was to clean and preprocess a "Customer Call List" dataset to improve its quality and usefulness for further analysis.

### Steps Taken:
- **Removing Duplicates**: 
  - Eliminated duplicate entries to ensure data uniqueness.
- **Dropping Irrelevant Columns**:
  - Removed columns such as `Not_Useful_Column`.
- **Phone Number Standardization**:
  - Cleaned and formatted phone numbers to a consistent `XXX-XXX-XXXX` format.
- **Handling Missing Data**:
  - Replaced 'N/a' with empty strings and dropped rows with missing phone numbers.
- **Categorical Normalization**:
  - Standardized categorical columns such as `Paying Customer` and `Do_Not_Contact` to 'Y'/'N'.
- **Row Removal**:
  - Removed rows marked as "Do Not Contact" or missing phone numbers.
- **Resetting Index**:
  - Reset the index to ensure a continuous, sequential index after cleaning.
